## Writing a DAG File for Apache Airflow in Python

 Introduction

Apache Airflow is a powerful workflow orchestration platform that helps in managing complex data pipelines and tasks. DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, are the building blocks of Airflow, representing the workflow of tasks to be executed. DAG files are Python scripts that define the DAG structure, including tasks, dependencies, and scheduling information.



### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Apache Airflow installed and running before creating a DAG file. You can install Airflow via pip:

### Creating a Python File

1. Create a Python file within the Airflow DAGs directory. This directory is typically set in the Airflow configuration file (airflow.cfg).

### Importing the Essential Modules

1. Import the required modules for working with Airflow DAGs:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator


### Defining Default Arguments

1. Set default arguments for the DAG, specifying common settings like start date, schedule frequency, and owner:

python
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': airflow.utils.dates.days_ago(1),
    'schedule_interval': '@daily',
}
